Releasing a Build
=================

Follow these steps to release a build of CYLGame.

1. Version Bump

   1. Change the version number in ``CYLGame/version.py`` to the version
      you wish to release. (Note: for bug fixes simply add one to the
      last number ex. ``1.6.22`` -> ``1.6.23``)
   2. Commit this change using git and the the following message:
      ``Version Bump`` (Example command
      ``git commit CYLGame/version.py -m "Version Bump"``)
   3. Create a tag for the version in git. (Example command
      ``git tag v1.6.23``)
   4. Push the commit and tag to github. (Example command
      ``git push origin master --tags``)

2. Check build

   1. **Check** https://travis-ci.com/UMDLARS/CYLGame **to make sure
      the build passes.**

3. Compile and Upload

   1. Run ``python setup.py sdist`` to compile.
   2. Run ``twine upload dist/*`` to upload the
      build to the Python Package Index (aka. the Cheese Shop).
