Installing (and Playing) a Game
===============================

This document explains how to install and play a generic CYLGame game on
a clean install of Ubuntu Linux. We will use the basic ‘Applehunt’ game,
but if you wish to install a different CYLGame modules, replace the git
repository and directories described in this document with the
appropriate values.

Getting Started
---------------

Install ``python3.7`` and ``pip``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa  # Only needed for Ubuntu 16.04
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3-pip libssl-dev python3.7 python3.7-dev 

Install ``git``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   sudo apt-get install git

Install ``pipenv``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   sudo python3.7 -m pip install pipenv

Clone the game repository (insert your game here)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   git clone https://github.com/UMDLARS/applehunt.git     # or a different game of your choice
   cd applehunt                                           # or the directory created in the previous line
   pipenv install

.. note::
   If you are using a newer (or older) version of python than ``3.7``, follow
   these instructions to upgrade the env. Note that changing python versions
   may require different versions of dependencies that things **may break**.
   If you already ran the ``pipenv install`` command above run ``pipenv --rm``.
   Open ``Pipfile`` with your favorite editor and change the line
   ``python_version = "3.7"`` to ``python_version = "YOUR_PYTHON_VERSION"``.
   Now run ``pipenv install --skip-lock`. You should now be ready to continue
   with the next step.

Running a Game Server on Localhost
~~~~~~~

From within the directory of the game in question (e.g., ``applehunt``),
run:

::

   pipenv run python game.py serve

This will start the game running on an application web server on the
``localhost`` interface, which you can access by going to:

``http://localhost:5000``

… in your web browser.

To make this game server accessible from the Internet or other hosts,
additional steps are required. We do this by forwarding a URL from our
web frontend to the game server running at a particular IP and port
(this can be on the same or a different machine). To specify the IP and
port for the game server, use:

::

   pipenv run python game.py serve --host IPADDRESS -p PORT -db GAME_DB

If you have any questions feel free to contact the devteam at
umdcyl-dev@d.umn.edu

Playing the Game On Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re developing or testing the game, you may want to play the game
on your own monitor (rather than through the web interface). To do this,
follow the above instructions, then:

::

   $ sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
   $ pipenv install --dev

To play the game:

::

   $ pipenv run python game.py play
